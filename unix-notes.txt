   My notes:
   lecture on history and philosophy of Unix os
   3 reasons Unix is good for devs
    1.  Small programs
    2.  Data as text (like JSON format) for storage
    3.  Input/output redirection

    Kernel –
    Manages hardware
    Sits between other programs and CPU
    Manages CPU, Memory, Devices
    Unix Kernel is safe from hackers (protected in safe part of memory)

    Unix Shell (command line)
    Sits between you and the kernel, lets you interface with it
    (name of shell comes from nut – the shell is the part that protects the “kernel” of the nut)

    Using command line
    Uname command (Unix name) – for windows I see MINGW32_NT-6.2
    Apple users see “Darwin”

    Long setup process – installing git, shell etc. for Mac machines.  I’ve already done this for Windows last night.  Don’t have some of the stuff they have.

    Installed “Scoop” just to see what it’s about.  Supposed to be a sort of HomeBrew for Windows.

    (ps needed to set executionpolicy to unrestricted to download this in the Windows Power
    Shell.

    Next:
    Reading the prompt.  I will use Console2 or Git Bash (either seems to work)

    “man” unix command does not work in Windows.  But Windows users can use what primitive man has used since the beginning of time: Google.  “man ls” in google will show the man page for ls

    If you have files or folders with spaces, escape them with \ before the space, e.g. cd my\ Music gets you to My Music folder.
